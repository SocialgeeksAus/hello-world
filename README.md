# hello-world
An intro to our Social Geeks Digital Agency and our Social Mission!
We are a digital marketing agency based in Queensland, Australia.  We are 100% Carbon Neutral and use renewable energy for our hosting.  
Our agency is experts at WordPress and eCommerce marketing, dabbling in front-end development with now wanting to focus more on creating React and Web3 apps.  
Our big focus in 2022 was to learn and contribute to the Origin Protocol, as we believe their DShop eCommerce platform is what the world needs - an open source Web3 eCommerce platform hosted on the IPFS.  We proposed to migrate this to Polygon, as they have pledged to go 100% Carbon Neutral and are currently paying for all Polygon use of IPFS storage.  Theoretically, this means Origin could have a freemium model ecommerce store to prove fee-less and trust-less ecommerce for the world at large.
Additionally, we are involved in an amazing Positive Psychology online game project which we're aiming to have developed and ready for market by the end of 2022.  
Lots happening and if you're reading this, we hope you are interested in joining us on the journey!
